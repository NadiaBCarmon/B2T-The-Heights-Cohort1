<h1><b>The Story So Far</b></h1>
<br>
<p><b>"Most recently I have been a Social Media and Content Writing Intern at the Digital Branding Institute where my duties include writing SEO-optimized content and developing social media campaigns. I work alongside our founder to develop content for our (online) digital branding resource as well as to create social activations that serve as a visual companion to blog content. In addition, last (insert month) I completed the Bridge-To-Tech program at The Knowledge House, where I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am passionate about using words and images to articulate brand messages, by combining my experience in social media, copywriting/content writing and web development." ~Nadia C </b></p>
